## **City of Portland: Designing an Open Contracting Program Front-end**  


Once you have accessed the container, proceed to start the front-end service. Follow the steps below depending on whether it's your first time running the front-end code or if there have been updates to the packages.

### Initial Run or After Package Updates
If this is your first time running the front-end code, or if there have been any updates to the packages, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This command installs all the dependencies defined in the package.json file. It is a crucial step to ensure that your front-end service runs smoothly with all the required packages.

### Starting the Front-end Service
After successfully installing the dependencies, or if you have already installed them in the past, start the front-end service by executing:
```
npm start
```
This command will compile the front-end code and typically starts a development server. Once the server is running, you should be able to access the front-end application.
